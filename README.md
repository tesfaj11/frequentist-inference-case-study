# Frequentist Inference Case Study – Part A

This notebook is part of my data science training through Springboard. In this project, I applied key frequentist statistical methods to explore and analyze health insurance charges.

### 📁 Files Included
- `Frequentist Inference - Part A.ipynb` – My notebook with step-by-step analysis
- `insurance2.csv` – The dataset used for the project

---

### 🔍 What I Did

In this assignment, I:
- Explored the dataset and calculated basic summary statistics
- Simulated the Central Limit Theorem by drawing random samples
- Calculated a 95% confidence interval for insurance charges
- Ran a hypothesis test to compare charges between smokers and non-smokers

---

### 📊 Key Takeaways
- The sample means formed a normal distribution, showing the Central Limit Theorem in action
- Smokers were found to pay significantly more for insurance, based on the t-test results
- Confidence intervals helped estimate the average charge with a margin of error

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (for statistical tests)

### 📘 Part B Summary

In Part B, I applied a two-proportion z-test to explore whether smokers are more likely to file insurance claims. The analysis showed a statistically significant difference, supporting the idea that smoking increases claim risk.
